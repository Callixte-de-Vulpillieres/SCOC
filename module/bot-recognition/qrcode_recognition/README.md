# QRCode Recognition Demo
This is a relatively simple demo that shows how to generate a qrcode and scann it using pyzbar python library.

## Pre-requisite
Install the required python modules:

        $ pip3 install opencv-python pyzbar time


## Scan the QrCode
We have to choose at first the fps that we want to work with by changing the variable $fps$.
Then make sure the camera is connected and execute the code which will display the output of the qrcode scan.
